3. **Add reward system** - Let kids redeem points for rewards
4. **Deploy to Render** - Share with the world!

## Bug We Just Fixed ✅
**Problem**: API routes under `/api/auth/` conflict with NextAuth
**Solution**: Move custom routes outside NextAuth path (e.g., `/api/register` instead of `/api/auth/register`)

## Common Bugs & Solutions 🐛

### Environment Variable Issues
**Problem**: `Error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL`
**Cause 1**: Extra characters in .env file (like % symbol)
**Cause 2**: Using `.env.local` instead of `.env` (Prisma prefers `.env`)
**Solution**: 
```bash
# If using .env.local, copy to .env:
cp .env.local .env
npx prisma db push

# Or recreate .env cleanly:
rm .env
cat > .env << 'EOF'
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
EOF
```

### Port Already in Use
**Problem**: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000`
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000:
sudo lsof -t -i tcp:3000 | xargs kill -9
# Or use different port:
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Missing dotenv Package
**Problem**: Various environment loading issues
**Solution**:
```bash
npm install dotenv
# Or for CLI usage:
npm install -D dotenv-cli
```
